Lab 1
This lab was geared towards helping us understand how to use C++ and it introduced us to List

Lab 2
This lab required us to build a doubly linked list from scratch. This is a list that points the node before and after it.

Lab 3
This lab required us to create the stack class from scratch using a list implementation

Lab 4
In this lab, we designed floating point numbers, and studied how they're represented.

Lab 5
We created an AVL tree, this is a tree that can balance itself so that the difference between the heights of the subtree 
is never more than one.

Lab 6
This lab we learned about the usefulness of hashtables and created one from scratch. I used a List implementation to create
my table.
